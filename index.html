			<p> &emsp; &emsp; Dr. McMahon, throughout my high school years you have challenged not only my ability to read a book, but also my ability
				to read a book well. The skills that I have attained through your education and classes will carry me well through my college years, and 
				hopefully beyond. As of writing this, you are still sick with COVID, and I hope that you feel much better soon. You were one of my (and
				my classes) favorite teachers, and we shared quite a few moments together that I think I would never have had if I was not in your literature
				classes.</p>
